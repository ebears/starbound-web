# How to Connect

In order to connect to the server, you first must enable **Allow Assets Mismatch** in the options menu when in Starbound.

Afterwards, connect to the IP and Port posted in Discord [here](https://discord.com/channels/818996933330337842/915398916973944902/915413188311384137).\
The **server account** and **server password** fields should be left blank.

***Note**: When creating a character, choose Survival for the best experience. Hunger is still enabled, but items are NOT dropped upon death.
