# ðŸš€ The Island's Starbound Server

<img src="media/starbound.png"/>

This website is to provide info for our Discord's dedicated Starbound server.

## ðŸ’¤ Info about the Server

The game has been modded to be greatly expanded in content, with deeper character RPG customization. These features along with more playable species offer a small-scale MMORPG-like experience.

## ðŸ”Œ How to Connect

In order to connect to the server, go to the multiplayer menu and connect to the **IP 192.46.223.180** and the **port 21025**.

The **server account** and **server password** fields should be left blank.

***Note**: When creating a character, choose Survival for the best experience. Hunger is still enabled, but items are NOT dropped upon death.*
