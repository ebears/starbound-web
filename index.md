# 🚀 The Island's Starbound Server

<img src="media/starbound.png"/>

This website is to provide info for our Discord's dedicated Starbound server.

## 💤 Info about the Server

The game has been modded to be greatly expanded in content, with deeper character RPG customization. These features along with more playable species offer a small-scale MMORPG-like experience.

## 🔌 How to Connect

In order to connect to the server, go to the multiplayer menu and connect to the **IP 192.46.223.180** and the **port 21025**.

The **server account** and **server password** fields should be left blank.

## 🐥 Gameplay Info

- There's no gameplay difference between Casual and Survival. Hunger is always enabled and only credits, not items, are dropped upon death.

- Frackin' Universe is a BIG mod. The [Wiki](https://frackinuniverse.miraheze.org/wiki/Main_Page) offers a plethora of useful information. You can read more about Frackin' Universe at the [official Github hosted website](https://sayterdarkwynd.github.io/home.html).

- I recommend setting the **Zoom Level** to 2x. In game, select *Options*, then *Graphics*. On the left side of the window, drag the zoom slider to your preference.

- The Quickbar menu in the top right corner contains a lot of useful features, be sure to check them out.
