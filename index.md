# 🚀 The Island's Starbound Server
<img src="starbound.png"/>

This website is to provide info for our Discord's dedicated Starbound server.

## 💤 Info about the Server

The game has been modded to be greatly expanded in content, with deeper character RPG customization. These features along with more playable species offer a small-scale MMORPG-like experience.

There's a lot of new content in game. I've done my best to streamline the experience with patches. Enjoy! 🦧

## 🐥 Gameplay Tips

- I recommend setting the **Zoom Level** to 2x. In game, select *Options*, then *Graphics*. On the left side of the window, drag the zoom slider to your preference.
- The Quickbar menu in the top right corner contains a lot of useful features, be sure to check them out.
